# SWCarpentryCribSheets

These are the notes I personally use during workshops when teaching for Software Carpentry. I have one file for each session (morning or afternoon, usually corresponding to one module of the [Software Carpentry lessons](http://software-carpentry.org/lessons.html). Some instructors like teaching directly from the web content, but I like making itemized lists to keep myself on track, hence these crib sheets. YMMV!

**A few things to keep in mind about these crib sheets:**
* These files are written in Markdown. You may find it useful to convert to a PDF for use in the classroom (I display them on my tablet while I'm teaching). One option for converting is [Pandoc](http://pandoc.org).
* These are notes, so it's necessary to read through the full lessons as well.
* Each lesson also has great instructor guides for each module (see a [Unix](http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/instructors.html) example). 
* These notes closely follow the canonical SWC materials, but have some ideas located in different places.
* The lessons are being constantly modified, so it's worth looking to see if anything has been added since the notes were made.
* It's likely that not all concepts included in these notes will be covered in one session, so choosing what to skip is still important.

**Things that aren't class content:**
* See the [class management](http://github.com/k8hertweck/SWCarpentryCribSheets/ClassManagement.md) page for more information on things that aren't content but you still need to remember (etherpad, sticky notes, etc).
* I use online quizzes, which are referenced in each crib sheet; see the [Socrative](http://github.com/k8hertweck/SWCarpentryCribSheets/Socrative.md) page for more information.
